# Front-End
## Phase 1
#### I have made two static sections: top and bottom. Top section is a grid layout and the bottom section is created with flexbox.
## Phase 2
#### In this phase i implemented JavaScript to make the static section in dynamic. I used GlidJS library to create a carousel for the Featured Products section.
## Phase 3
#### I made the carousel adaptive and related to the screen size. Redesigned the header and footer, and organized the page content differently on devices.
